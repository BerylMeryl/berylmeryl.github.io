    <p>First post and that's simply just to say that it's March 7th, which means it's the day of the camera creature too, Happy Birthday March 7th!!!!!<br>(I have never played Honkai Star Rail, nor do I ever intend to, but I just think she's cute and really really neat)</p>

    <p>For a bit of positivity first I got Maggiore Barraca fully limit broken on Azur Lane, so now I justs need to level her more and get her to level 125 and I also got Cheshire unlocked a couple days ago (' w'), that aside I had a salted caramel frappe this morning during my commute, wish I could afford another on the way back though.<br><br>Now on a negative note I've not been feeling all too great today, just very lonely and left to the wayside recently (sorry to those close to me if I came off as clingy, but I've not been doing good and really just wanted any form of attention), against my best interests I did force myself to go into University today, but it is proving very hard, I cried on the train over a few times and again on the bus, and I am only able to half pay attention to my lecture currently in order to keep myself from breaking down here, so it has proven to be really rough and it's not even lunch yet, today really just sucks tbh and I wish I stayed in bed instead of trying.<br>Things will probably get better but they're going to get much worse before they do, and I am really do not want to be there for that but I just have to persist despite everything.</p>
