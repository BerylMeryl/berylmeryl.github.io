<h1>Meryl's Blogging Space ' w'</h1>
<p>Hi there I'm Meryl my pronouns are she/her and I started transitioning in late 2024.<br><br>Welcome to my blog, this is just a simple space for me to yap and air my thoughts (my thoughts will be almost completely unfiltered so expect things to get a bit deep) alongside sharing some bits and pieces.<br><br>I'm primarily interested in videogames and sociology, I enjoy playing PSO2, Monster Hunter, and Pokémon but I've also really been into Azur Lane as of late.<br><br>Sorry for the brutalist style of this blog, I'll change it eventually but I'm pretty busy rn with Life Stuff™ so it's a bit of a pain.</p>

<h3>I really do not know what I am doing anymore tbh. - 12/3/2025</h3>
      <p>The past 3, fuck, 4 years I feel that I've wasted my life, I feel pressured to succeed in university especially since I have ASD.<br><br>Life is just, yeah....<br><br>A lot of emotions were had yesterday, I stepped down from my wiki, I drank a shit load of alcohol, I am utterly exhausted and feel like I am only going on to prove to the people who want me to succeed that I can, it's just all very tiring. I really do not know what to do, I have wasted 4 years of my life so far pissing around with university, with one more year left to go so I might as well stick it out for now, but I am not happy and I really HATE myself for letting it get this far. If I am being really fucking honest with myself here.<br><br>Loneliness has crept up again, though it is hitting me in absolute spades, I just want someone again... Blegh, I really hate this feeling, I really can't keep living like this, I had my chances before but I fucking blew them so hard that I can't do anything about it now, it's just blegh...<br><br>Speaking a bit more positively(???) I really wish I had parents or family that could afford pissing away money on me so I could just perpetually keep open a business that is a café during the morning (5am-10am) and bar during the night (6pm-4am, need an hour to clean up and shift to café mode), then base the aesthetic around what I like with a menu of drinks curated by me, then just meet new people, talk, and serve as a really nice hangout spot for friends when things get rough or if they just want to relax too and grab something to drink, it wouldn't exactly be easy work but it'd be fulfilling and honestly make me feel like I have some sense of control over my life right now, it's a dream but... It would be nice.</p>

<h3>What am I doing? - 11/3/2025</h3>

     <p>Awake early today and a bit sleepy because of a morning lecture, though I felt somewhat cute this morning and decided to wear my turtleneck, I'm not exactly "feelin' fine" yet but I am just managing, though I expect this to fluctuate throughout the week since it has been a wild few days, though the second I am home in the next few hours I will hit my pillow and sleep so quickly... (very much looking forward to it).<br><br>For a slight update too: to be completely honest I think I am about to experience complete and absolute burnout, it's very hard to just relax when there's a lot on your shoulders so I may make the unfortunate decision to just stop producing certain resources (including but not limited to the pso2ngs.wiki), whilst these projects are like my children and I really do not want to see them go, I do feel like it may be necessary to just completely stop them as it is not having a good impact on my health, it would be helpful if I had a larger team to help me cover more general broader aspects of it alongside the major backlog, however with that project in particular I may just cut my losses entirely, it is unhealthy and I don't particularly enjoy it anymore (I still actually do like it, but it's really REALLY complicated blegh).<br><br>Speaking more specifically about pso2ngs.wiki for a minute, but this is something that I am going to have to weigh in my own time and it isn't looking good for the future of the project, whilst I respect the work others had put into it I personally feel very little will to support the project further due to my own health and wellbeing and I understand though that this is effectively a repeat of what happened to Cirnopedia (something I was trying to avoid and may do if someone else steps up), so I may offer resources to another editor and give them control of the project from here out (no matter what happens I will be saving the XML files and sharing my resources on a Google Drive if anyone wants to pick up the project).<br><br>I really want to just start being able to focus on forging my relationships with others further and just not have much else on the side to do just hovering over me, it's that simple really, I'll take a week or so to decide however but I think we all know what the likely outcome is going to be, for what it's worth I enjoyed it and learned some pretty useful skills.<br><br>I want to get my life back on track and out of this massive rut, especially as there will soon potentially be major changes as I move forward month by month.</p>

<h3>So that happened... - 10/3/2025</h3>
    <p>A friend of mine may or may have not confessed last night, it's weird though because whilst I didn't need it since y'know, could lead into a toxic relationship given my current mental, I kinda just needed some sort of affirmation that someone, anyone really, was willing to put up with me on that level where they'd admit to loving me, for now I've politely declined and expressed when things get better I'll be in a better position to give an answer (though not to lead them on or anything, just because it genuinely isn't healthy rn for one).<br><br>Ultimately today is feeling a bit off kilter because of it, though that's fine, feeling good isn't always easy and it'll be a long road before I manage to feel good about myself, but knowing I have supportive friends and people who are willing to express such emotions towards me is all I need to know to move on one day at a time.<br><br>Also sidenote but I slept for 4 hours last night and my left shoulder is still aching from being hungover, we love shit genetics and lack of sleep YEAH!!!!!<br></p>

<h3>Good Morning - 9/3/2025</h3>
    <p>Good morning all, I don't necessarily feel better today, however I did end up talking to a friend last night about some things, though they weren't one which I was afraid who has been ignoring me, it did make me realise that I should've considered how other people would feel about me being afraid to message others over the past few days, especially as I consider this individual very close to me and should've taken their needs into account too, as I don't want them to worry about me especially as they know what I am going through so they're unfortunately going to expect the worst.<br><br>I don't feel better after yesterday but I do feel calmer but that could be due to how I'm currently a bit hungover after drinking mixers yesterday whilst playing Va-11 Hall-A, though a moment stood out which did cause me to stop playing for the night and caused me to cry for a bit then to mull over responding, being Alma talking about the warmth of another person, it's not something that I need right now given my state but is is something I want to be able to work up to sometime in the future as I need to be in the position to support myself first as I don't want to be the cause of or attract toxic relationships, as much as a girlfriend would help and would make me feel loved, it's very volatile for me to consider at this moment as it can easily turn sour.<br><br>Don't think I'll have many other thoughts to share today as I'm going to take it easy just watching things and playing some mobile games whilst recovering somewhat from this hangover and sorting the emotions currently rattling around in my head, so stay safe all I'm going to lay down.<br></p>

<h3>Man... :( - 8/3/2025</h3>
    <p>I honestly don't know what to put for today or even what to do, I'm just very out of it, I was going to wax but I still feel like shit so I'm probably just going to continue doing nothing today, I also just really feel like all my friends are just putting up with me and always have, since I seemingly have to be the one to send a message first and this isn't helped by how I am stuck in a dingy town with nobody around me and nothing to do it is genuinely depressing as hell around here and isn't helping my mental state, especially as I just lack money to get a train and a hotel to stay in the city for a night just so I can hangout with friends.<br><br>I've also been idly thinking about just disappearing and starting fresh somewhere, but it'd never work and I don't want to leave anyone behind even if I do feel like they're just putting up with me for now. Though dropping university even though I'm almost done with my second to last year has creeped up in my thoughts more than I'd like it to, but what do I really have to gain from finishing this degree, the job market sucks right now and I honestly would prefer to have a nice cozy job like starting my own florists. I am exhausted.<br><br>Both this week and last week for the most part I had told myself "I feel good" but I feel that I've just been lying to myself and now it's just all finally coming out. I've been up since about 1am today just ignoring everyone around me and sporadically crying, so I am just going to go back to sleep, which whilst certainly isn't healthy behaviour I feel trapped and it's not like I can do much else on my mind without hurting myself or others around me.<br></p>
    <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/va11halla/images/d/d7/Dorothy_Haze.png" alt="omg haiii Dorothy" class="inline" style="width:180px;height:150px;"/><br>
    <p>I plan to play more Va-11 Hall-A tonight with some pizza and drinks, I've found the game to be melancholic in a soothing way but I don't feel particularly bad when it makes me cry, Dorothy is also incredibly precious, I just want to see her thrive and succeed alongside everyone else around me, I haven't worked up the courage to speak to friends about anything though and I've been non-verbal the past couple days so maybe in a few days after I'm more relaxed and less fragile I'll be able to work up that courage, though I'm sure some of them are worrying about me right now and all I can say is I am sorry that I can't bring myself to respond yet, if any of you are reading this I am not doing alright but I am fine so please don't worry much and I understand this is selfish behaviour, but I just need alone time.<br><br>Fanta and roku gin goes together very nicely, though I wish I had someone to share it with...</p>

<h3>It's March 7th!!! - 7/3/2025</h3>
<img src="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/6318ed11a0c41e40951dca41/65a8400d01783c4cea5dedaf/65cd11a5b58b0c6b7509ab48/1708213432383/march_7th___honkai__star_rail_render_by_syahrul1995_dfzdoem-fullview.png?format=1500w" alt="omg haiii March 7th" class="inline" style="width:186px;height:141px;"/><br>
    <p>First post and that's simply just to say that it's March 7th, which means it's the day of the camera creature too, Happy Birthday March 7th!!!!!<br>(I have never played Honkai Star Rail, nor do I ever intend to, but I just think she's cute and really really neat)</p>
    <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/bhlx/images/5/59/CheshireSpring.png" alt="picture of Chesire from Azur Lane" class="inline" style="width:200px;height:219px;"/><br>
    <p>For a bit of positivity first I got Maggiore Barraca fully limit broken on Azur Lane, so now I justs need to level her more and get her to level 125 and I also got Cheshire unlocked a couple days ago (' w'), that aside I had a salted caramel frappe this morning during my commute, wish I could afford another on the way back though.<br><br>Now on a negative note I've not been feeling all too great today, just very lonely and left to the wayside recently (sorry to those close to me if I came off as clingy, but I've not been doing good and really just wanted any form of attention), against my best interests I did force myself to go into University today, but it is proving very hard, I cried on the train over a few times and again on the bus, and I am only able to half pay attention to my lecture currently in order to keep myself from breaking down here, so it has proven to be really rough and it's not even lunch yet, today really just sucks tbh and I wish I stayed in bed instead of trying.<br>Things will probably get better but they're going to get much worse before they do, and I am really do not want to be there for that but I just have to persist despite everything.<br><br>Update: Decided to leave early, can't be bothered to go back on the train and potentially breakdown in a public setting so someone is driving me back (thank you, you know who you are), probably going to sleep once I am back and then just run a frozen pizza in the oven whilst I have a bath when I'm awake later, despite the fact I've been breaking my diet as of late but I find immense comfort in pizza so it is what it is really...<br><br>To end off my thoughts for today I got given a waxing kit that I am looking forward to using tomorrow or the day after, would've done it yesterday or today but my mood doesn't need the pain from waxing rn, so expect the next post to be about how smooth my face and legs feel or something because ngl I love how it feels to be smooth, I am very much looking forward to it just because it makes knee-highs that much comfier to wear. ~w~</p>
