<h1>Meryl's Blogging Space ' w'</h1>
<p>Hi there I'm Meryl my pronouns are she/her and I started transitioning in late 2024.<br><br>Welcome to my blog, this is just a simple space for me to yap and air my thoughts alongside sharing some bits and pieces.<br><br>I'm primarily interested in videogames and sociology, I enjoy playing PSO2, Monster Hunter, and Pokémon but I've also really been into Azur Lane as of late.<br><br>Sorry for the brutalist style of this blog, I'll change it eventually but I'm pretty busy rn with Life Stuff™ so it's a bit of a pain.</p>

<h3>Man... :( - 8/3/2025</h3>
    <p>I honestly don't know what to put for today or even what to do, I'm just very out of it, I was going to wax but I still feel like shit so I'm probably just going to continue doing nothing today, I also just really feel like all my friends are just putting up with me and always have, since I seemingly have to be the one to send a message first and this isn't helped by how I am stuck in a dingy town with nobody around me and nothing to do it is genuinely depressing as hell around here and isn't helping my mental state, especially as I just lack money to get a train and a hotel to stay in the city for a night just so I can hangout with friends.<br><br>I've also been idly thinking about just disappearing and starting fresh somewhere, but it'd never work and I don't want to leave anyone behind even if I do feel like they're just putting up with me for now. Though dropping university even though I'm almost done with my second to last year has creeped up in my thoughts more than I'd like it to, but what do I really have to gain from finishing this degree, the job market sucks right now and I honestly would prefer to have a nice cozy job like starting my own florists. I am exhausted.<br><br>I've been up since about 1am today just ignoring everyone around me and sporadically crying, so I am just going to go back to sleep, which whilst certainly isn't healthy behaviour I feel trapped and it's not like I can do much else on my mind without hurting myself or others around me.<br><br>Todays Main Mood: Isolated</p>

    <p>First post and that's simply just to say that it's March 7th, which means it's the day of the camera creature too, Happy Birthday March 7th!!!!!<br>(I have never played Honkai Star Rail, nor do I ever intend to, but I just think she's cute and really really neat)</p>

    <p>For a bit of positivity first I got Maggiore Barraca fully limit broken on Azur Lane, so now I justs need to level her more and get her to level 125 and I also got Cheshire unlocked a couple days ago (' w'), that aside I had a salted caramel frappe this morning during my commute, wish I could afford another on the way back though.<br><br>Now on a negative note I've not been feeling all too great today, just very lonely and left to the wayside recently (sorry to those close to me if I came off as clingy, but I've not been doing good and really just wanted any form of attention), against my best interests I did force myself to go into University today, but it is proving very hard, I cried on the train over a few times and again on the bus, and I am only able to half pay attention to my lecture currently in order to keep myself from breaking down here, so it has proven to be really rough and it's not even lunch yet, today really just sucks tbh and I wish I stayed in bed instead of trying.<br>Things will probably get better but they're going to get much worse before they do, and I am really do not want to be there for that but I just have to persist despite everything.<br><br>Update: Decided to leave early, can't be bothered to go back on the train and potentially breakdown in a public setting so someone is driving me back (thank you, you know who you are), probably going to sleep once I am back and then just run a frozen pizza in the oven whilst I have a bath when I'm awake later, despite the fact I've been breaking my diet as of late but I find immense comfort in pizza so it is what it is really...<br><br>To end off my thoughts for today I got given a waxing kit that I am looking forward to using tomorrow or the day after, would've done it yesterday or today but my mood doesn't need the pain from waxing rn, so expect the next post to be about how smooth my face and legs feel or something because ngl I love how it feels to be smooth, I am very much looking forward to it just because it makes knee-highs that much comfier to wear. ~w~</p>
