    <p>First psot and that's simply just to say that it's March 7th, which means it's the day of the camera creature too! (I have never played Honkai Star Rail but I just think she's cute and really really neat)<br> Though to start off on a negative note I've not been feeling all too great today, just very lonely and left to the wayside, against my best interests I did force myself to go into University today, but it is proving very hard to make it through today, which kinda sucks tbh.</p>
