    <p>First post and that's simply just to say that it's March 7th, which means it's the day of the camera creature too! (I have never played Honkai Star Rail, nor do I ever intend to, but I just think she's cute and really really neat)<br>For a bit of positivity first I got Maggiore Barraca fully limit broken on Azur Lane, so now I justs need to level her more and get her to level 125, and alongside that I had a salted caramel frappe this morning during my commute.<br>Now on a negative note I've not been feeling all too great today, just very lonely and left to the wayside, against my best interests I did force myself to go into University today, but it is proving very hard, I cried on the train over a few times and again on the bus, and I am only able to half pay attention to my lecture currently in order to keep myself from breaking down here, so it has proven to be really rough and it's not even lunch yet, today really just sucks tbh and I wish I stayed in bed instead of trying.</p>
