<h1>Meryl's Blogging Space ' w'</h1>
<p>Hi there I'm Meryl my pronouns are she/her and I started transitioning in late 2024.<br><br>Welcome to my blog, this is just a simple space for me to yap and air my thoughts (my thoughts will be almost completely unfiltered so expect things to get a bit deep) alongside sharing some bits and pieces.<br><br>I'm primarily interested in videogames and sociology, I enjoy playing PSO2, Monster Hunter, and Pokémon but I've also really been into Azur Lane as of late.<br><br>Sorry for the brutalist style of this blog, I'll change it eventually but I'm pretty busy rn with Life Stuff™ so it's a bit of a pain.</p>

<h3>Small Update - 14/3/2025</h3>

      <p>I've been a lot calmer the past two days, there's some things that I need to sort out, specifically I need to face my old friends and ex again and have a proper talk near the end of the month, but I'm ready to heal and ready to start moving on, no more running, I've ran too long and it led to a lot of regrets the past few months alongside the worst time of my life, it's hard to climb out of a spiral if you're willingly running down further and further, but after reaching the bottom I either lay at the bottom and rot or work my way back up, and I am not letting despair get the better of me again, she wouldn't have wanted me to waste my life like this (and is probably been glaring at me for the past two years to get off my ass and find my passion again), so the only way from here out is up.</p>
